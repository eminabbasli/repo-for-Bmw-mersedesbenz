    <p>Mercedes-Benz is focussing on higher-priced luxury vehicles to increase profitability. It also plans to upgrade
        its product portfolio and speed up electrification.

        Around 75% of the car manufacturer’s investments will flow into developing top-end products with the highest
        margins and profitability. Sharpening its business strategy, Mercedes-Benz will cut some entry-level vehicles,
        in effect trimming its portfolio. By 2026, the carmaker hopes this will increase the sale of top-end luxury
        vehicles by 60%.

        Cutting low-end models
        The Stuttgart-based automotive player emphasised that its strategic approach would lead to better financial
        results, especially as market conditions remain challenging. Mercedes-Benz expects strong demand for high-end
        luxury cars, which allows it to offset rising raw-material costs with higher prices.

        ‘What has always been the core of our brand is now also the core of our strategy: the luxury segment,’ said Ola
        Källenius, chairman of the board of management at Mercedes-Benz Group.

        ‘We are further sharpening the focus of our business model and product portfolio in order to maximise the
        potential of Mercedes-Benz even in challenging conditions. At the heart of that is our goal to build the world’s
        most desirable cars.’

        The company wants to turn its attention to three product categories – top-end luxury, core luxury, and entry
        luxury. In the entry luxury segment, Mercedes-Benz will cut the number of model variants from seven to four.
        However, the company did not specify which models would be affected. Entry-level models include the A and
        B-Class compact cars, which might now see an end to their production.

        Luxury cars
        The carmaker recently unveiled examples of high-end vehicles, including a bespoke concept known as the
        Mercedes-Maybach Haute Voiture, which it describes as the pinnacle of sophisticated luxury. The model will hit
        the market in 2023 in a limited edition, making it a very exclusive car.

        Overall, Mercedes-Maybach is expanding its product offering in the top-end segment, led by the Mercedes-Maybach
        EQS SUV, which is due to launch next year. Other models in the carmaker’s high-end luxury segment include all
        vehicles from Mercedes-AMG, as well as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and G-Class models, and the full-size luxury
        GLS.

        ‘Most luxury companies build their portfolio on the basis of one or two true icons. Mercedes-Benz has the good
        fortune to have multiple iconic products and brands at the upper end of its portfolio – such as the S-Class, the
        SL, the G as well as the AMG and Maybach brands,’ said Källenius. ‘We see great potential here to expand our
        top-end portfolio with even more fascinating products for our customers.’

        The news of Mercedes Benz’s new strategy comes at a time when carmakers are increasing prices because of market
        complications brought on by the war in Ukraine, semiconductor shortages, and pandemic-related shutdowns in
        China. This has led to widespread supply-chain issues, production pauses, and delivery delays for many
        automotive companies.

        Despite disruptive market developments in the first quarter, Mercedes-Benz reported a rise in earnings before
        interest and taxes (EBIT) to €5.2 billion, with price hikes helping the carmaker to improve profits. The
        manufacturer recently confirmed it had sold the world’s most expensive car, a rare 1955 Mercedes-Benz SLR coupe,
        to a private owner for a staggering €135 million.</p>

    <p> there are upgrades throughout, one that illustrates the substance of the CS is its curb weight. The BMW M5 CS
        is over 230 lbs lighter than the standard M5 Competition. How? Standard carbon ceramic brakes reduced curb
        weight by 51 lbs and the elimination of the rear bench (replaced by two minimal buckets) make the biggest visual
        statement. But much of that comes in the details such as wheels, sound deadening and use of carbon fiber.
        Elsewhere the M Division has given the CS stiffer engine mounts (5,139 lb/in vs. 3,312 lb/in) than the standard
        M5 Sedan, 10% firmer springs, 0.2-inch lower ride height, increased front negative camber, a firmer rear
        anti-roll bar and tow-link ball-joint mounts. The M5 CS receives further spring and Dynamic Damper Control
        tuning over the M5 Competition to take advantage of the lower vehicle weight and of the optionally available
        (no-cost) Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. The result is a car that hit 60 mph in a conservative 2.9 seconds and tops
        out at 190 mph. And given that the Nurburgring is literally etched into the headrests, expect an improvement on
        the 7:38 time of the current BMW M5 Competition. The 2022 BMW M5 CS will start from $142,000 when it goes on
        sale this March. US deliveries should commence in the second half of 2022. </p>
